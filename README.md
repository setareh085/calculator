🧮 Calculator Project
This project demonstrates different implementations of a calculator using Python.  
It includes a text-based CLI version, a GUI version with Tkinter, and helper functions.

⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.10+  
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 🚀 Run the Project
To run the project, start the main menu:
```
python run.py

```
You can then choose:

- 1 → CLI calculator

- 2 → GUI calculator
## 📝 Notes

The CLI calculator uses helper functions (to_check.py) and the OOP module (calculator_oop.py).

The GUI calculator is built with Tkinter and supports basic arithmetic operations.

This repository is published on GitHub as a portfolio project to demonstrate Python programming skills.

Project created for practicing Python (CLI, OOP, GUI) and modular programming.

## 📘 What I Learned
In this project, I learned how to implement a calculator in different ways: a text-based CLI version, an object-oriented (OOP) version, and a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. This helped me strengthen both fundamental and advanced Python concepts.
